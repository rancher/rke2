# Upgrading Rke2 Clusters



This section describes how to upgrade your rke2 cluster.

[Upgrade basics](basic_upgrade.md) describes several techniques for upgrading your cluster manually. It can also be used as a basis for upgrading through third-party Infrastructure-as-Code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

[Automated upgrades](automated_upgrade.md) describes how to perform Kubernetes-native automated upgrades using Rancher's [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller).
